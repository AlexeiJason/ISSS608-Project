This project aims to develop nowcasting methods tailored for investment, domestic trade, and household survey indicators, enabling timely and accurate assessments of economic conditions. \nHere is our approach on the project to achieve our objective: \n\nInstalling Packages \n\nInstalling necessary R packages that we are going to use for our projects such as tidyverse, ggrepel, patchwork, ggthemes etc. \n\nData Preparation \n\nAcquire open government datasets related to historical investment, domestic trade, and household survey results. Standardize data formats and ensure consistency across datasets. Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. \n\n Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) \n\nConduct exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics and patterns within the datasets. Identify key variables that are indicative of economic trends and activity. \n\nNowcasting Implementation \n\nCreate predictive models to predict current or near-future economic state of Singapore by performing exploration on various nowcasting methods and implement them into the analysis framework. \n\nVisualization and Interpretation \n\nCreate and develop dashboards and web frameworks with R Shiny that provide interactive visualizations to communicate the findings and insights derived from the nowcasting models.",
