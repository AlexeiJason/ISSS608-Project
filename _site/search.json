    "text": "Motivation \nThe motivation behind our project stems from the urgent need for more immediate economic insights in the fast-paced economic environment of Singapore. The conventional approach to economic forecasting and analysis is no longer sufficient to meet the demands of a dynamic global economy, and the challenge of reducing the time lag in economic data analysis is non-trivial. It requires innovative methodologies that can accurately predict current economic conditions using incomplete or near-real-time data. This is where nowcasting comes into play, offering a promising solution by utilizing the latest available data to estimate present economic conditions. \nThe issues of data timeliness and the intricate nature of economic relationships within Singapore make this topic particularly challenging—and interesting—to solve.",

    "text": "Objectives and Approach \nThe objective of this proposal is to leverage open government data to gain insights into the state of the economy using historical investment and domestic trade data, along with household survey information. This project aims to develop nowcasting methods tailored for investment, domestic trade, and household survey indicators, enabling timely and accurate assessments of economic conditions. \nHere is our approach on the project to achieve our objective: \n\nInstalling Packages \n\nInstalling necessary R packages that we are going to use for our projects such as tidyverse, ggrepel, patchwork, ggthemes etc. \n\nData Preparation \n\nAcquire open government datasets related to historical investment, domestic trade, and household survey results. Standardize data formats and ensure consistency across datasets. Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. \n\n Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) \n\nConduct exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics and patterns within the datasets. Identify key variables that are indicative of economic trends and activity. \n\nNowcasting Implementation \n\nCreate predictive models to predict current or near-future economic state of Singapore by performing exploration on various nowcasting methods and implement them into the analysis framework. \n\nVisualization and Interpretation \n\nCreate and develop dashboards and web frameworks with R Shiny that provide interactive visualizations to communicate the findings and insights derived from the nowcasting models.",

These EDAs will serve the purpose to show interactively growth of economic state in Singapore in the past years. Using the raw data, users can make their own prediction and interpretation on how the current, future, or past economic states of Singapore is. \n\n\nNowcasting (Predictive modelling)\nThe second methodology that we are going to used is to create a predictive model for Singapore current or near future economic state throughout multiple aspects. We are going to build and visualize the prediction of aspects of Singapore economic states.",

Traditional economic forecasting methods, while useful, often fall short in today’s rapidly evolving market environments. These methods typically rely on historical data that, by the time of analysis and publication, may no longer reflect current economic realities. This latency in traditional forecasting poses significant challenges for policymakers, businesses, and investors who rely on timely data to make critical decisions.",
